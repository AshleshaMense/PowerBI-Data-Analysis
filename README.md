**Airline Analysis**

*Overview:*
This project is a data analysis conducted on airline data using PowerBI. The aim of this analysis is to explore various aspects of airline operations, performance, and insights on flight schedule. 
The data used in this analysis includes flight data, operational metrics, departure details, flights cancelled, delayed and all the required information.

*Features:*
Data Visualization: Utilizing PowerBI's robust visualization capabilities to present insights in a visually appealing manner.
Interactive Dashboards: Creation of interactive dashboards allowing users to explore the data dynamically.
Performance Metrics: Analyzing key performance indicators such as on-time performance, flight delays, airline details, flights cancelled,etc.
Trend Analysis: Identifying trends and patterns in airline operations and airline traffic over time.
Comparative Analysis: Conducting comparative analysis between different airlines,time periods.

**Customer Churn Analysis**

*Overview:*
This project entails an in-depth analysis of customer churn using PowerBI. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon of customers ceasing to do business with a company. 
The goal of this analysis is to identify factors contributing to churn, understand patterns of customer behavior, and devise strategies to mitigate churn rates.

*Features:*
Data Visualization: Utilizing PowerBI's rich visualization capabilities to present churn-related insights effectively.
Interactive Dashboards: Developing interactive dashboards enabling users to explore churn metrics dynamically.
Root Cause Analysis: Identifying underlying reasons for churn through detailed analysis of customer interactions, feedback, and service usage patterns.
Churn Rate Monitoring: Tracking churn rates over time to assess the effectiveness of retention strategies and interventions.
